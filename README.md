# Password-Generator
This is a random password generator. When the generate password button is clicked, a series 
of prompts will come on the screen asking for some criteria for your password. First, it will ask you how many
characters would you like to have in your password. There can be no less than 8, and no more than 128 characters
in the password. Then, it will ask if you want the password to include lower and upper case letters, numbers, and special characters. 
It has to include at least one of the character types. When all the criteria for the password is met, the page will generate a password at random 
and display it on the screen.
